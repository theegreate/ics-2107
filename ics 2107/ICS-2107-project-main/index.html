    <h1 id="myH1">Overview of The Internet</h1>
    <p>The <b>Internet</b> is a collection of computers that communicate using a standard set of protocols.
        Since there are now millions of computers involved in the Internet, it has grown to be 
        a major means of communication
        and allows for users to interact with little regard to distance or location. 
        Associated with the Internet is a set
        of technologies ranging from network protocols to browsers that have been developed to support Internet
        operations. This Chapter gives a description of the basis of these Internet technologies and how these 
        can be used by corporations to improve their operations.</p>

    <p> The structure of the Internet is first described with an overview of network standards and the ISO seven
        layer network model. TCP/IP is then described together with the use of routers to route the packets and the
        use of Internet addressing. 
        This leads to a description of the World Wide Web (WWW) and the use of the
        Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).The implementation of Internet technologies is then addressed with a
        description of the growth in the size and usage of the Internet and the future use of
        Internet technologies.
        Corporate use of Internet technologies is then described with a description of Intranets and Extranets and
        the phases that corporations tend to pass through in implementing Internet technologies. An example
        corporation, Deere & Co., is then profiled on their usage of Internet technologies and how these
        technologies are beginning to reach into every facet of company operations.</p></section>

        <h2 id="myH2"><b>History of the Internet</b></h2>
        <p>The history of the Internet originated in the efforts of scientists and engineers to build and 
            interconnect computer networks. The Internet Protocol Suite, the set of rules used to communicate
            between networks and devices on the Internet, arose from research and development in the United States
            and involved international collaboration, particularly with researchers in the United Kingdom and
            France.<br>

            Computer science was an emerging discipline in the late 1950s that began to consider time-sharing 
            between computer users, and later, the possibility of achieving this over wide area networks.
            J. C. R. Licklider developed the idea of a universal network at the Information Processing Techniques
            Office (IPTO) of the United States Department of Defense (DoD) Advanced Research Projects Agency
            (ARPA). Independently, Paul Baran at the RAND Corporation proposed a distributed network based 
            on data in message blocks in the early 1960s, and Donald Davies conceived of packet switching in
            1965 at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), proposing a national commercial data network in 
            the United Kingdom.<br><br>
            
            ARPA awarded contracts in 1969 for the development of the ARPANET project, directed by Robert Taylor 
            and managed by Lawrence Roberts. ARPANET adopted the packet switching technology proposed by Davies 
            and Baran. The network of Interface Message Processors (IMPs) was built by a team at Bolt, Beranek, 
            and Newman, with the design and specification led by Bob Kahn. The host-to-host protocol was specified
            by a group of graduate students at UCLA, led by Steve Crocker, along with Jon Postel and others. 
            The ARPANET expanded rapidly across the United States with connections to the United Kingdom and Norway.<br><br>

            Several early packet-switched networks emerged in the 1970s which researched and provided data
            networking. Louis Pouzin and Hubert Zimmermann pioneered a simplified end-to-end approach to 
            internetworking at the IRIA. Peter Kirstein put internetworking into practice at University
            College London in 1973. Bob Metcalfe developed the theory behind Ethernet and the PARC Universal 
            Packet. ARPA initiatives and the International Network Working Group developed and refined ideas 
            for internetworking, in which multiple separate networks could be joined into a network of networks.
            Vint Cerf, now at Stanford University, and Bob Kahn, now at DARPA, published their research on
            internetworking in 1974. Through the Internet Experiment Note series and later RFCs this evolved
            into the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), two protocols of the
            Internet protocol suite. The design included concepts pioneered in the French CYCLADES project
            directed by Louis Pouzin. The development of packet switching networks was underpinned by
            mathematical work in the 1970s by Leonard Kleinrock at UCLA.<br><br>
            
            In the late 1970s, national and international public data networks emerged based on the X.25 protocol,
            designed by Rémi Després and others. In the United States, the National Science Foundation (NSF) 
            funded national supercomputing centers at several universities in the United States, and provided 
            interconnectivity in 1986 with the NSFNET project, thus creating network access to these supercomputer
            sites for research and academic organizations in the United States. International connections to 
            NSFNET, the emergence of architecture such as the Domain Name System, and the adoption of TCP/IP on
            existing networks in the United States and around the world marked the beginnings of the Internet.
            Commercial Internet service providers (ISPs) emerged in 1989 in the United States and Australia.
            Limited private connections to parts of the Internet by officially commercial entities emerged in
            several American cities by late 1989 and 1990.[8] The optical backbone of the NSFNET was 
            decommissioned in 1995, removing the last restrictions on the use of the Internet to carry
            commercial traffic, as traffic transitioned to optical networks managed by Sprint, MCI and
            AT&T in the United States.<br><br>
            
            Research at CERN in Switzerland by the British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee in 1989–90 resulted
            in the World Wide Web, linking hypertext documents into an information system, accessible from any 
            node on the network.[9] The dramatic expansion of the capacity of the Internet, enabled by the advent
            of wave division multiplexing (WDM) and the rollout of fiber optic cables in the mid-1990s, had a
            revolutionary impact on culture, commerce, and technology. This made possible the rise of 
            near-instant communication by electronic mail, instant messaging, voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)
            telephone calls, video chat, and the World Wide Web with its discussion forums, blogs, social 
            networking services, and online shopping sites. Increasing amounts of data are transmitted at 
            higher and higher speeds over fiber-optic networks operating at 1 Gbit/s, 10 Gbit/s, and 800 Gbit/s 
            by 2019.[10] The Internet's takeover of the global communication landscape was rapid in historical
            terms: it only communicated 1% of the information flowing through two-way telecommunications 
            networks in the year 1993, 51% by 2000, and more than 97% of the telecommunicated information
            by 2007.[11] The Internet continues to grow, driven by ever greater amounts of online information,
            commerce, entertainment, and social networking services. However, the future of the global 
            network may be shaped by regional differences.<br><br></p>
